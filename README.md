# indoor_position_fingerprint

A simple fingerprinting-based localization project:

- Setting up the beacons in a corridor of size 30m x 2.35m. 
- Creating the reference map by getting the RSS at predefined locations. Here, we took 20 measurements.
- An interpolating observation model was developed.
- A quasi-constant dynamic model was added.
- A particle filter was built for the same.
- Results were evaluated.

Beacons used were from kontact.io
