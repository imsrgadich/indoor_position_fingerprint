## Abstract

## Introduction 
-----------------
#### Indoor positioning.
#### State Space Models.
#### Bayesian Filtering.
#### Various methods used from ovbservations.md
#### Various challenges involved in Indoor Positioning.
#### What has been done in this project.

## Background
#### Dynamic Model
------------------
Weiner velocity model

So, the coordinated turn model turns out to be the optimal choice for the
tracking the dynamics of the system. The states tracked are the position(x and
y coordinate), linear velocity(v), angular velocity(omega)

#### Measurement Model
#### PSIS Particle Filter


## Methods Implemented
----------------------
#### Positioning using GP measurement model
#### Positioning using K-NN measurement model


## Experiments and Results
--------------------------

## Future Work
--------------
Random walk model for PF
Latent Variable Model for GP modelling.
