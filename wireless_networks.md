# Notes from Wireless Sensor Netwroks: Principles, Design and Applications, Shuang-Hua Yang
## Chapter 2:Principles of Wireless Sensor Networks
- Hard wired - last meter connectivity problem, hence need for wireless networks.
- Advances in sensor technology have made many problems scalable. (size: MEMS, NEMS, processing capabilities, battery powered, ease of installation, low cost). One problem is security. 

### IEEE 802.15.4 Standard and Wireless Sensor Network

- OSI model - 7 layers: physical, data link, network, transport,**session**, **presentation**(both removed, as it would make the model complex), application.
- OSI model forms the basis for the Wireless Sensor Network(WSN).
	- Physical layer: connections between devices and configuration for them.
	- Data Link layer: medium for communication and access between nodes.
	- Network Layer: establishing communication between nodes. sending and receiving packets. (data link vs network?)
		- choosing protocol crucial for application using WSN (energy saving protocols....)
	- Transpor Layer: ?
	- Application Layer: sensing the information, lives closest to the user.
